# Window rules
# Refer to section 2.6: window rules

# Window rules are dynamic and always refresh and keep themselves up to date
# Properties like on-workspace, is-focused, etc.
#
# The match strings are Regexes, so you can get creative with what you match
# in the app-id or title. Nothing is impossible!

# All windows on workspace 6 (so index 5) will be floating and centered
# [[rules]]
# on-workspace = 5
# floating = true
# centered = true

# Web browsers get send on output eDP-1 on workspace 2
# [[rules]]
# match-app-id = ["LibreWolf", "Firefox"]
# open-on-output = "eDP-1"
# open-on-workspace = 1

# Chat clients open on workspace 3
# [[rules]]
# match-app-id = ["Discord", "Telegram"]
# match-title = [".*Telegram.*"] # all of these are Regexes!
# open-on-workspace = 2

# You can also have stricter rule sets using `match-all = true`, in order to make the rule
# apply only if all criteria matches
#
# For example windows opening output HDMI-A-1 that are on workspace 5 must be
# fullscreened.
# [[rules]]
# match-all = true
# on-output = "HDMI-A-1"
# on-workspace = 4
# fullscreen = true

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Layer-shell rules
# Refer to section 2.7: layer rules
# ---
# These are mostly used to enable effects on layer shells
# Example here to enable blur for wofi
# [[layer-rules]]
# corner-radius = 25
# match-namespace = ["wofi"]
# blur = { disable = false, noise = 0, passes = 4, radius = 1 }
# shadow = {  color = "black", disable = false }
