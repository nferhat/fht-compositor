# Example configuration for fht-compositor.
# This configuration uses the TOML format: https://toml.io/en/
# 
# This configuration is enough to get you started. Refer to the wiki for more details.
# You can open it using: `cd fht-compositor/docs && mdbook serve --open`


# If you need any applications to run when the compositor is starting, (for example, wallpaper,
# sound daemon, notification daemon, etc...), add them here.
#
# Each entry is a full cmdline that will be executed using `/bin/sh -c "<ITEM>"`, so you benefit
# from shell expansion.

# NOTE: Window rule order matter, since they combine and stack up.
# If window rule 1, 3 and 4 match onto a Window, the compositor will apply the rules from 1, then 3,
# then 4 onto the said window.

# All windows on workspace 6 (so index 5) will be floating and centered
# [[rules]]
# on-workspace = 5
# floating = true
# centered = true

# Web browsers get send on output eDP-1 on workspace 2
# [[rules]]
# match-app-id = ["LibreWolf", "Firefox"]
# open-on-output = "eDP-1"
# open-on-workspace = 1

# Chat clients open on workspace 3
# [[rules]]
# match-app-id = ["Discord", "Telegram"]
# match-title = [".*Telegram.*"] # all of these are Regexes!
# open-on-workspace = 2

# You can also have stricter rule sets using `match-all = true`, in order to make the rule
# apply only if all criteria matches
#
# For example windows opening output HDMI-A-1 that are on workspace 5 must be
# fullscreened.
# [[rules]]
# match-all = true
# on-output = "HDMI-A-1"
# on-workspace = 4
# fullscreen = true
