# Input device configuration

You can configure various input device functionality under `fht-compositor` thanks to [libinput](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libinput/).

## Keyboard configuration

> [!NOTE]
> As of writing this, keyboard configuration is **only global**, IE. you can't set it per-device. This is a limitation of the
> wl-seat protocol, allowing for only one configuration at a time.

#### `rules`, `model`, `layout`, `variant`, `options`

These are all [XKB](https://www.x.org/wiki/XKB/) settings.

- You can find out available keyboard rules, variants and options from the `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst` file, or using `localectl` (see `man 5 localectl`)
- You can find the correct keyboard layout for yourself [on this page](https://xkeyboard-config.pages.freedesktop.org/website/layouts/gallery/)

By default, all these are empty strings (using system defaults), and layout is `us`

---

#### `repeat-rate`, `repeat-delay`

These two options control key repeating. `repeat-delay` is the delay in milliseconds that you should hold down a key for repeating to
start. `repeat-rate` is the frequency at which the key is repeated.

Default settings are `repeat-rate=25`, `repeat-delay=250`

## Mouse settings

Mouse settings. The compositor (libinput) will figure out automatically which setting should be applied or not,
and whether the connected mouse type supports a given feature.

Depending on your mouse type, you can use:
- `mouse`: For generic mice
- `touchpad`: For laptop touchpads
- `trackpoint`: For trackpoint (usually found on Thinkpads)

> [!NOTE] Default mouse settings
> If an option does not have a default specified, it is up to the device driver (IE. libinput) to choose one.

#### `acceleration-profile`

How should the pointer cursor accelerate with mouse movement. Available values are:
- `adaptive`: Takes the current speed of the device into account when deciding on acceleration.
- `linear`: Constant factor `acceleration-speed` applied to all deltas, regardless of the speed of motion.

---

#### `acceleration-speed`

A factor to multiply mouse movement delta with. Must be in the range `[-1.0, 1.0]`

Default is `1.0`

---

#### `left-handed`

Whether to enable left handed mode for the device. This will swap the left and right clicks.

---

#### `scroll-method`

For touchpads, determines how to emulate a scroll wheel using only your fingers (and no dedicated button). Available values are:
- `no-scroll`: Disable scrolling emulation.
- `two-finger`: Scrolling is triggered by two fingers being placed on the surface of the touchpad.
- `edge`: Scrolling is triggered by moving a single finger along the right edge (vertical scroll) or bottom edge (horizontal scroll).
- `on-button-down`: Converts the motion of a device into scroll events while a designated button is held down. This is common in ThinkPad trackpoints

---

#### `scroll-button`, `scroll-button-lock`

The button used to enable `on-button-down` scroll method. When `scroll-button-lock` is enabled, the button does not need to be held
down, and instead turns the button into a toggle switch.

---

#### `click-method`

Determines how button events are triggered on a touchpad/[clickpad](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/clickpad-softbuttons.html#clickpad-softbuttons)s.
Available values are:

- `button-areas`: The bottom area is divided into three thirds, like the following:

- `click-finger`: Emulate clicks based on the number of fingers used, 1 is left, 2 is right, 3 is middle.

---

#### `natural-scrolling`

Whether to enable natural scrolling.

Natural scrolling matches the motion of the scroll device with the motion of the **content**

---

#### `middle-button-emulation`

Whether to emulate a left+right click at the same time as a middle click. The middle click is the one you have when you
click on your mouse's scroll wheel.

---

#### `disable-while-typing`

The name is clear enough.

---

#### `tap-to-click`, `tap-button-map`

Whether to emulate clicking on touchpads/clickpads by tapping the surface.

`tap-button-map` changes how tap-to-click behaves. Available maps/modes are: `left-right-middle`, `left-middle-right` (for
1 finger, 2 finger and 3 finger taps respectively)

---

#### `tap-and-drag`, `drag-lock`

Whether to enable Tap-and-drag. If a tap is shortly followed by the finger being held down, moving the finger around will
*drag around* the selected item from the tap.

Having `drag-lock` enabled will make the dragging process persist even when lifting the finger from the touchpad, and instead
will require a final tap to let go of the grabbed item.

## Per-device configuration

You can configure each registered input device individually. Per-device configuration is a table, which keys can be:
- The device pretty name (AKA. the readable name, which you would see in a device manager)
- A raw device path, `/dev/input/eventX`

To find out which devices you have connected, you can execute in a shell <br>
```sh
# You might need root privileges to run this
libinput list-devices | grep Device:
```

---

- `disable`: Whether to completely disable this device.
- `mouse`: Same as `input.mouse/touchpad/trackpoint`, but for this device only.
